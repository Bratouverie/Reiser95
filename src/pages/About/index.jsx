                        When you buy a truly expensive thing from a known brand, you get a certificate of authenticity, a plastic card with numbers, which allows you to receive warranty service and additional benefits, such as access to a business lounge at the airport, VIP service and a pass to private events.

                    <p className="text">
                        Our idea is to replace plastic with NFT. Anyone who confirms the authenticity of their branded item will be able to become a member of our movement, purchase and link an NFT certificate to their branded item on our platform.

                        The value of such an NFT lies in the presence of a connection between material and virtual objects. You get the opportunity to demonstrate in the virtual world that you have attributes of prestige in the material world.

                        Do you own such things as Rolls-Roys, Rollex, Prada or a bottle of Red Label? Why not announce about it to the entire metaverse?

                        Unfortunately, it is not possible to buy several NFTs at the same time. You can buy only one at a time and only after confirming the authenticity of the branded item. Further, every year, we will buy 10% of NFT certificates issued on our platform. The point of this action is that as the number of NFT certificates issued increases, the previously issued ones will have more and more value in the future. Thus, by supporting us now, you can count on higher rewards in the future.

                        It is important for professional investors to know that we have copyrights to the material-virtual object system deposited in the blockchain. Based on the expert's opinion on the patentability of the technology, measures are being taken to prepare an application for a patent. Technology is a sequence of actions from production to marketing to connect material and virtual objects. The peculiarity of the technology is the ease of implementation in production and reliability. Also, this technology will be fully implemented by us on our platform and brand representatives will be able to use the ready-made system for certifying their products at no additional cost, since the business model embedded in the technology distributes the financial burden among platform users without increasing the cost of production. To summarize, using our platform, brands will be able to provide their consumers with additional value without increasing the cost of products, and users will receive additional benefits. The cost of an NFT certificate is high and may exceed the cost of a real thing.
